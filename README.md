# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1) Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
= Software development is the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software products.
== it enables the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


2) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
=The birth of nsoftware engeineering
=Introduction od structured programming- use of control structures instead of arbitrary jumps
=The Agile manifesto


3) List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
=Planning
=Requirrments gathering
=Design
=Coding
=Testing
=Deployment
=Maintenance


4) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
=Waterfall is ideal for projects with clear, unchanging requirements and a need for strong documentation. Agile is better suited for projects with dynamic requirements and those that benefit from regular customer input and flexibility

5) Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
=Software developers are responsible for designing, coding, and implementing software applications. They may specialize in front-end, back-end, or full-stack development.
=QA engineers focus on maintaining the quality and functionality of the software. They perform testing to identify any bugs or issues that could affect user experience.
=Project managers oversee the entire software development process, ensuring that projects are completed on time, within budget

6) Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
= IDEs provide a comprehensive suite of tools within a single interface, simplifying and accelerating software development eg; vs code
= VCSs enable developers to track and manage changes to code over time, allowing for organized, traceable modifications across the project's lifespan.eg; git


7) What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
=Rapid change of technologies; Remedy= continous learning
=Debugging complex issues; Remedy= use debugging tools


8) Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
= Unit testing involves testing individual components or “units” of code, typically at the function or method level, in isolation from other parts of the application.
= Integration testing involves combining individual units and testing them as a group. It checks if different components work together as expected.
= System testing evaluates the entire application as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements. This is often done on a complete, fully integrated system
=Acceptance testing, sometimes called user acceptance testing (UAT), determines whether the application meets the business requirements and is ready for delivery to the end-users.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
=Prompt engineering is the process of crafting instructions to AI so that it can give you specific and desirred responses
=Enhanced Accuracy and Reliability
=Improved User Experience
=Efficient Use of AI Capabilities


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
=Write about a famous author.==Vague
=Write a brief biography of Jane Austen, focusing on her major works, literary style, and influence on the romantic fiction genre.==improvesd prompt
